Labor unions have always championed the cause for workers to have more time to thrive. Worker productivity has soared since establishing the 40-hour work week over 80 years ago, but these gains have only translated into soaring profits for corporations, not workers. The pandemic has highlighted that our current work-time structure isn't serving workers well. Meanwhile, global pilot programs, including those in the U.S. public sector, have demonstrated that a 32-hour work week not only benefits workers but also maintains or even boosts productivity. Additionally, it enriches society by allowing workers to prioritize their families and invest in their communities.

We are asking our negotiators to prioritize the 32-hour workweek, and weâ€™re fully committed to supporting it every step of the way.

As of writting this post, we are currently at over 700 signatures which is about 4% of the total number of employees represented by MAPE. We are still actively hosting information sessions and gaining more signatures all the time. Our goal is to have 10% of MAPE-represented employees sign by the negotiations convention in September!

The time is ripe for working people to take back more of our lives, so that all workers can spend time doing the things they love with the people they love. MAPE can lead the way by fighting for the 32-hour workweek in 2025 contract negotiations. 

[If you haven't yet signed the 32-hour workweek letter of support, please take the time to do so now!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSO3hfpis1Ed5TYIZgJYg8GaNFkJn_xzQCI9243oPY_lGntQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
