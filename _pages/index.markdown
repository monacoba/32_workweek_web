title: "What is a 32-hour workweek?"
permalink: /
---

The MAPE 32-Hour campaign team is a group of state workers across locals and regions who are taking up labor's centuries-long fight for more time. We are parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, neighbors, friends, writers, readers, gardeners, hikers, gamers, dancers, boxers, travelers, homebodies, dreamers, and doers, and we know that in this short life, we all deserve more time to do the things we love, with the people we love, in the places we love. 

We're joining a growing global movement for a shorter workweek that is already demonstrating that this shift is possible. We want a 32-hour workweek, with no loss in pay or benefits, for all workers. We believe MAPE can lead the way in Minnesota, and we're organizing to that end.
